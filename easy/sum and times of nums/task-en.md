Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.
 

## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 234
Output: 15 
Explanation: 
Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 
Result = 24 - 9 = 15
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4421
Output: 21
Explanation: 
Product of digits = 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32 
Sum of digits = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11 
Result = 32 - 11 = 21
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5

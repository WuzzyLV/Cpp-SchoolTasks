# [1672. Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/description/) Easy
You are given an `m x n` integer grid accounts where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the `j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​` bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

 

## Example 1:
    Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
    Output: `6`
    Explanation:
    1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
    2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
    Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
    Example 2:

## Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
    Output: 10
    Explanation: 
    1st customer has wealth = 6
    2nd customer has wealth = 10 
    3rd customer has wealth = 8
    The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

## Example 3:
    Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
    Output: 17
